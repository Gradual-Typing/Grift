Description: This pass performs closure conversion and optimization based off
of the paper Optimizing closures in O(n) time. A cursory analysis shows that
we don't quite get O(n) time, instead I think we are O(n^3). At this point
I am not really concerned about the runtime. 


- Closure Conversion is performed by the function `uncover-closure-ops`:
 - Records the free variables of each closure in the `Closure` form.
 - Reduces the number of free variables by eliminating free variables that are
   known to be :
   - bound to constants (constant propagation)
   - aliases of other free variables (copy propagation)
   - references to the current closure (self reference)
 - Generates names for the closure self-parameter and closure code
 - Calls function code directly when a closure is known (direct call optimization)
- Closure optimization is performed by the function `optimize-closures`:
  - Identifies closures with the same lifetime 
    - uses Tarjan algorithm to identify strongly connected components formed by
      variable capture.
  - When one or more well-known closures exist with the same life 
    we share a single closure for the well-known closures.
  - When a closure is not well known but has no free variables
    then we statically allocate the closure and eliminate free
    variables that reference it.
  - Take into account all free-variables eliminated by sharing,
    statically allocating closures, and eliminating closure
    allocations in the next step.
  - Select representations for closures that minimize space, 
    maximize sharing, without extending the lifetime of any
    closure.
    - *Well-Known w/ No Free Variable* No Closure
    - *Well-Known w/ 1 Free Variable* Lambda Lift the one variable
    - *Well-Known w/ more than 1 Free Variables* allocate free variable in a tuple
    - *Not Well-Known w/ No Free Variable* Static Allocated Closure
    - *Otherwise* allocate closure normally

Terminology:
- a closure is *well-known* if we know where all of its call sites are.
  - we conservatively estimate this property by checking to see if the
    closure is found in any argument position.
- a closure is *known* if we know that a variable binds it at a particular
  location.

TODO Investigate adding a stateful payload to Uids this could remove several
     hash table lookups.
TODO We can generate better code in this pass for function casts.
